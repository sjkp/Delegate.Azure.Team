#Azure Functions
New Azure Service announced during build 2016. As a response to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

```
Run code without thinking about servers.
Pay for only the compute time you consume.
``` 

Azure Functions aims to make it easier to build web job like functionality (as you don't have to create a app hosting plan, app service plan and storage accounts to get started).

##Why pick Functions?
The only real reason for us as developers would be because of Dynamic pricing. Everything else is subpar what you get with real Web Jobs. 

##Question
Would you use something like Azure Functions, if so, in which use cases?
