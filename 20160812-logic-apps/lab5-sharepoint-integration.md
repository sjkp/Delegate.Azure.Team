#Lab 5 - SharePoint Integration

The challenge is to setup a workflow that does the following: 

1. Use the onedrive connector to trigger when an image is uploaded to one drive for business
2. Send the image to Computer Vision API from Microsoft Cognitive Service to get a description of the image (https://dev.projectoxford.ai/docs/services/56f91f2d778daf23d8ec6739/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa)
3. Save the description back to a list in a SharePoint Online Site (imagine a scenario where the IT department want to track what kind of images people store in their onedrive)
