# Lab 3b - Process Images in Azure Functions, using nuget libraries

So far we have not been using any third party assemblies, in this lab we are going to try to include a nuget package that allows us to use on of the cognetive services to do some image 
magic. 

* Get familiar with how you reference external libraries [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/functions-reference-csharp/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/functions-reference-csharp/)
* Take a look at Hanselmans sample using the API to detect faces in images, try to implement his solution (or be creative and do something on your own): [http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WhatIsServerlessComputingExploringAzureFunctions.aspx](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WhatIsServerlessComputingExploringAzureFunctions.aspx)
